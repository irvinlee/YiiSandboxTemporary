About this Branch
=================

This branch contains an installation of the latest Behat and Mink
beta versions - behat-2.4.0beta3 and mink-1.4.0beta2.

These new versions were made to be much more flexible in how you can
interact and override core elements of Behat. That's probably not
interesting for most people, but it will other options on how to
bootstrap Yii.

We also have 2 additional features

* iFrame/window management
* The assertion engine
